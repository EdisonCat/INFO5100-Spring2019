Constructors

- Constructor is a piece of code in the class that gets executed when an object is created
- A class can have multiple constructors (with different input parameters)
- A constructor can invoke another constructor using this(<<with parameters>>) as the first statement in the constructor
- this key word can be prefixe in front of a instance variable to differentiate between the input to constructor and the instance name
- Constructors should not have a return type (not even void)
- Every Object will have a default constructor (provided by JVM) only if we don't write any constructors

Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is a mechanism to hide accessing data of an Object directly from outside
- Encapsulation is achieved by a scope named private that is attached to the instance variable
- Every data should be made private and it can be accessed by a public xxx getXXX(){} method also known as accessor
- Every data should be made private and it can be mutated by a public void setXXX(XXX xxx){} method, also known as mutator
- Logic can be written in mutator to ensure that data is  not corrupted


Abstraction 

- Focusing on what as against how
- Define behaviors in a way where each behavior can invoke another behavior as against writing all the logic in one behavior (drive())
